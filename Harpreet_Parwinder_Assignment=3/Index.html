            <h2><b>Trout</b></h2>
            <p>Trout use a variety of colors and patterns to blend in with their surroundings. Trout that live at sea or have returned lately have a silvery appearance, whereas fish in streams or mountain lakes have distinct patterning and vibrant colors. Intensely colored breeding trout may resemble distinct species. Though it might be difficult to identify certain breeds by color patterns, wild trout tend to have brighter colors.<br>
                Including a little adipose fin close to the tail, trout have fins without spines. Back close to the anus is where their pelvic fins are located. Their swim bladder, called a physostome, is attached to the esophagus and facilitates rapid swallowing or air displacement. Because they do not use their bladders to absorb oxygen, trout, in contrast to other physostome fish, only use their gills.</p>

        <h2><b>Habitat</b></h2>
        <p>Lakes and chilly, clear streams are home to trout, many of which are anadromous. Fry, troutlet, or troutling are terms used to describe young trout. Natural habitats for them include Europe, northern Asia, and North America. Local fish species were displaced in Australia and New Zealand during the 1800s when recreational fishermen brought different kinds of trout there.<br>Among these were steelhead rainbow trout from California and brown trout from England; rainbow trout from New Zealand continued to exhibit migratory behavior during winter spawning.</p>        <ul>

        <h2><b>Physical Appearance</b></h2>
        <p>Trout live in a variety of environments, such as big lakes and mountain streams, and they need clean, cold water to survive. Like salmon, they have soft-rayed fins with tiny scales far back on the body and an adipose fin behind the solitary dorsal fin.<br>

            Fish in huge lakes frequently have a silvery look, whereas trout in streams tend to have spots or wavy lines on backgrounds ranging from dark olive to light brown. Their sizes also differ substantially; for example, brook trout in streams usually weigh two pounds, but Great Lakes steelhead can weigh up to fifteen pounds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Size:</b>The average size of a brook trout is 9 to 10 inches, but a 12-inch specimen is highly sought-after as a trophy capture.</li>
                <li><b>Distinctive patterns</b>Trout, in contrast to many other kinds of trout, have cream-colored dots on a black backdrop. The spots under the lateral line are spherical, red, and encircled by a blue halo, but the dots on their dorsal surface are elongated and worm-like. Their distinctive bottom fins are white with a black stripe and several tones of orange, yellow, and red along the leading edge.</li>
                <li><b>Habitat</b>Brook trout like cool, clear, and clean streams for their habitat. </li>
                <li><b>Food</b>Their main food source is aquatic insects, such as nymphs, which are found beneath rocks and on the banks of streams. During hatching, they also consume adult insects as food. They also eat land insects that fall into the water, such as ants, grasshoppers, and beetles. When available, they also eat tiny crayfish and minnows.</li>

        <h2><b>Reproduction</b></h2>
        <img src="Images/Image 2.jpeg" alt="Trout 1" class="Reproduction img">
        <p>Trout spawn at a time when they are around two years old.In shallow sections of streams and inlets, where the female may manipulate the gravel with her tail to construct a redd- nest-, spawning occurs.<br>
         When the redd is finished, she and a male partner will let the eggs and milt into the nest, whereupon fertilization takes place. The female will then apply the gravel she first cleared over the red. Both of the adult trout depart, but the female will keep reproducing until all 400â€“3000 eggs that are kept in her body cavity have been discharged.</p>
